# Milestone v1.0 Audit — HACS Structure Migration

**Audited:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** ⚡ tech_debt — All requirements satisfied, no critical blockers, documentation gaps to note

## Score Summary

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 18/18 | All satisfied per 3-source cross-reference |
| Phases | 2/2 | Both phases complete |
| Integration | 18/18 | All 18 requirements wired across phases |
| E2E Flows | 1/1 | File relocation → CI validation → HACS-ready flow complete |

## Definition of Done (from ROADMAP.md)

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All integration files at `custom_components/franklin_wh/` | ✓ | Commit 5f5e8cc, confirmed on disk |
| `hacs.json` no `content_in_root` or `zip_release` | ✓ | hacs.json = `{"name": "FranklinWH"}` |
| HACS validate.yaml passing | ✓ | Run 22510541931: success |
| Hassfest passing | ✓ | Run 22510541929: success |
| README clean of workaround language | ✓ | No grep matches for content_in_root/zip_release |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Source 1: VERIFICATION.md Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Assessment |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| 01-file-relocation | **MISSING** | Verification gap — phase completed but verify-work was not run |
| 02-verification-and-documentation | **MISSING** | Verification gap — phase completed but verify-work was not run |

### Source 2: SUMMARY.md Frontmatter (`requirements-completed`)

| Phase | Requirements Listed |
|-------|---------------------|
| 01-file-relocation | FILE-01, FILE-02, FILE-03, FILE-04, FILE-05, FILE-06, FILE-07, FILE-08, FILE-09, FILE-10, FILE-11, FILE-12, CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03 |
| 02-verification-and-documentation | VERIF-01, VERIF-02, VERIF-03 |

All 18 v1 requirements claimed completed across the two phases.

### Source 3: REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability

| REQ-ID | Checkbox | Traceability Status |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| FILE-01 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-02 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-03 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-04 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-05 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-06 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-07 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-08 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-09 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-10 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-11 | `[x]` | Complete |
| FILE-12 | `[x]` | Complete |
| CONF-01 | `[x]` | Complete |
| CONF-02 | `[x]` | Complete |
| CONF-03 | `[x]` | Complete |
| VERIF-01 | `[ ]` | **Pending** ← inconsistency: SUMMARY says complete, CI confirms |
| VERIF-02 | `[ ]` | **Pending** ← inconsistency: SUMMARY says complete, CI confirms |
| VERIF-03 | `[x]` | Complete |

### Final Status Matrix

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| FILE-01..12 | missing | listed (phase 01) | `[x]` | **partial** (verification gap) |
| CONF-01..03 | missing | listed (phase 01) | `[x]` | **partial** (verification gap) |
| VERIF-01 | missing | listed (phase 02) | `[ ]` | **partial** (dual gap: missing VERIFICATION.md + unchecked checkbox) |
| VERIF-02 | missing | listed (phase 02) | `[ ]` | **partial** (dual gap: missing VERIFICATION.md + unchecked checkbox) |
| VERIF-03 | missing | listed (phase 02) | `[x]` | **partial** (verification gap) |

**Assessment:** All 18 requirements are classified "partial" due to missing VERIFICATION.md artifacts. No requirements are "unsatisfied" — the underlying functionality is confirmed by SUMMARY evidence, live CI results (run IDs 22510541931 and 22510541929), and integration checker verification of all files on disk. The gaps are **documentation tracking gaps only**, not functional regressions.

**Orphan detection:** All 18 requirements in the traceability table are present in SUMMARY.md frontmatter. **No orphaned requirements.**

## Integration Check Results

Integration checker confirmed **all 18 requirements fully wired** across phases:

| Phase Boundary | Wiring | Status |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Phase 01 → Phase 02 | File structure created by Phase 1 consumed by Phase 2 CI validators | WIRED |
| Phase 02 CI output | HACS validate + hassfest both pass on current main | WIRED |

**E2E Flow: File Relocation → CI Validation → HACS-Ready**

| Step | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Files at `custom_components/franklin_wh/` (11 files) | ✓ Confirmed on disk |
| 2 | `hacs.json` name-only (no workarounds) | ✓ Confirmed |
| 3 | Single atomic commit 5f5e8cc | ✓ Git history |
| 4 | Rename history preserved via `git mv` | ✓ `git log --follow` works |
| 5 | `manifest.json` keys sorted (hassfest requirement) | ✓ Commit 0958b7f |
| 6 | Root `translations/` removed | ✓ Not present |
| 7 | README clean of workaround language | ✓ No grep matches |
| 8 | CI workflows trigger on push | ✓ `on: push` in both WFs |
| 9 | HACS validate passing (run 22510541931) | ✓ success |
| 10 | Hassfest passing (run 22510541929) | ✓ success |

**Result: 1/1 flows complete. No broken steps.**

## Tech Debt (Non-Critical)

### Phase 01: File Relocation
- **Missing VERIFICATION.md** — The verify-work step was not run for this phase. Evidence of completion exists in `01-01-SUMMARY.md` (requirements-completed frontmatter) and git history (commit 5f5e8cc), but the standard GSD verification artifact is absent. No functional impact.

### Phase 02: Verification and Documentation
- **Missing VERIFICATION.md** — Same as above. Evidence of completion exists in `02-01-SUMMARY.md`, CI run IDs (22510541931, 22510541929), and integration checker disk verification.
- **REQUIREMENTS.md VERIF-01 and VERIF-02 checkboxes not updated** — Both are still `[ ]` (Pending) in REQUIREMENTS.md despite being satisfied. The traceability table status also still shows "Pending" for both. Should be updated to `[x]` and "Complete" to match actual state.

### Total: 3 items across 2 phases (all documentation-only, no functional impact)
