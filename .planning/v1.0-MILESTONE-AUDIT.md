# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 15/18 requirements satisfied

## Requirements Coverage

### 3-Source Cross-Reference

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| FILE-01 | MISSING (no VERIFICATION.md) | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-02 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-03 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-04 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-05 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-06 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-07 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-08 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-09 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-10 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-11 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| FILE-12 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| CONF-01 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| CONF-02 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| CONF-03 | MISSING | listed | `[x]` | **partial** (physically confirmed correct) |
| VERIF-01 | MISSING (Phase 2 not started) | not listed | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| VERIF-02 | MISSING (Phase 2 not started) | not listed | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| VERIF-03 | MISSING (Phase 2 not started) | not listed | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |

**Note on Phase 1 "partial" status:** Phase 1 has no VERIFICATION.md (workflow blocker), but the SUMMARY frontmatter lists all 15 requirements as completed, REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes are all `[x]`, and direct repository inspection confirms all Phase 1 success criteria are physically met:
- All 11 integration files present at `custom_components/franklin_wh/`
- `hacs.json` contains only `{"name": "FranklinWH"}`
- No loose Python or JSON files at repo root
- All changes in a single atomic commit (`5f5e8cc`)

Phase 1 requirements are treated as **satisfied** for audit purposes despite missing VERIFICATION.md. The absence of VERIFICATION.md is tech debt, not a functional gap.

---

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | VERIFICATION.md | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1: File Relocation | Complete | MISSING | Output physically correct; missing VERIFICATION.md is tech debt |
| Phase 2: Verification and Documentation | Not started | N/A | No directory exists |

---

## Unsatisfied Requirements (Blockers)

### VERIF-01: HACS validation workflow passes
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (not started)
- **Reason:** GitHub Actions `hacs/action` workflow exists and is correctly wired to the migrated structure, but has not been confirmed to pass on the current HEAD. Structural prerequisites (correct directory layout, clean hacs.json) are satisfied by Phase 01.

### VERIF-02: hassfest workflow passes
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (not started)
- **Reason:** GitHub Actions `home-assistant/actions/hassfest` workflow exists and is correctly wired, but has not been confirmed to pass on the current HEAD. Structural prerequisites satisfied by Phase 01.

### VERIF-03: README updated for standard HACS installation
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (not started)
- **Reason:** README content appears to already describe standard HACS installation, but Phase 2 owns formal verification that the instructions reflect the migrated path and do not reference the old `content_in_root` workaround.

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Phase 01 → Phase 02 Wiring

| Connection | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `custom_components/franklin_wh/` layout → HACS action | WIRED | Correct path present |
| `manifest.json` → hassfest | WIRED | All required fields present |
| `hacs.json` (name-only) → hacs/action | WIRED | No problematic keys |
| Atomic commit → deployment confidence | WIRED | Single commit `5f5e8cc` |
| Phase 01 output → Phase 02 CI inputs | SATISFIED | All structural prerequisites ready |

### Issues
- **Root `translations/` directory (empty):** git mv of `translations/en.json` left an empty `translations/` directory at repo root. Harmless to CI but a cleanliness issue. Remove in Phase 2 cleanup.

---

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Breaks At |
|------|--------|----------|
| HACS installation: user installs FranklinWH via HACS | Incomplete | CI confirmation gate — Phase 02 must confirm VERIF-01 and VERIF-02 pass |

**Structural prerequisites (Phase 01 complete):**
- HACS discovers `custom_components/franklin_wh/` ✓
- HACS reads `hacs.json` (clean, name-only) ✓
- hassfest reads `manifest.json` (all required fields) ✓

**Missing (Phase 02):**
- GitHub Actions HACS validation confirmed passing ✗
- GitHub Actions hassfest confirmed passing ✗

---

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: File Relocation
- **Missing VERIFICATION.md:** Phase executed without creating a VERIFICATION.md. Structural output is confirmed correct, but process debt. Phase 2 can optionally create a retroactive VERIFICATION.md.
- **Empty root `translations/` directory:** Leftover from `git mv translations/en.json`. Remove before or during Phase 2.

---

## Summary

Phase 01 was executed correctly — all 15 file relocation and configuration requirements are fulfilled. The milestone cannot complete because Phase 02 (Verification and Documentation) has not been planned or executed.

**To close the milestone:** Plan and execute Phase 2 to confirm CI passes and verify README documentation.
